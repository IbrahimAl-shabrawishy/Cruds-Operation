# Cruds-Operation
This example demonstrates a simple web application that allows users to create a product, view a list of products, and search through them. The CRUD operations are implemented using basic HTML forms, JavaScript for logic and data handling, and CSS for styling. This structure can be expanded upon to include update and delete functionalities as needed.
